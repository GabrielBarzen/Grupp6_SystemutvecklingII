## New Codebase
The new codebase was created in sprint 4. </br>
The developers for sprint 4 made the decision to create the new codebase as the architecture and structure of the old codebase  was difficult to develop for and contained other fundamental issues.

### Instructions
1. Run server </br>
   Run the bundled configuration : ```NEW_run_server```</br>
2. Run client </br>
   Run the bundled configuration : ```NEW_run_client```</br>

## Original codebase
The original codebase is the code inherited from the previous project group. </br>
This codebase primarily programed on until sprint 4.

### Instructions
1. Run server </br>
Run the bundled configuration : ```OLD_run_server```</br>
2. Run client </br>
Run the bundled configuration : ```OLD_run_client```</br>
